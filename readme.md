Encrypts and decrypts a plain text message using a one-time pad (OTP).

    This code takes user input for a plain text message and performs the following steps:
    1. Generates a one-time pad (OTP) consisting of random letters.
    2. Encrypts the plain text message using the OTP.
    3. Decrypts the ciphertext back to the original plain text.

    The user is prompted for input, and the results are displayed on the console.
